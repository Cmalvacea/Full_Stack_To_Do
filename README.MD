This is a full stack APP made with the MEVN stack, use it as you see fitting, but first of all you must know how to activate it

1 - Define the DB URL in the env file in the backend folder
2 - Define the PORT you will be working
3 - Go to the front end folder and change the port of the url axios requests
4 - Start the backend server, then the frontend
5 - Create an acount and start using!

The backend has two NPM commands, "database" for activating the database if you are using a local cluster, in this case we are using mongodb/mongoose, so start with this first
and "start" to start the server

I hope you enjoy
